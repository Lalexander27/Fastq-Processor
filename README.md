# Fastq-Processor
Example program that processes FASTQ data, reports amino acid counts of proteins, and trims sequences based on quality scores.  This program features 3 main functions as follows:
parser() accepts a file name and yields the header, sequence, and quality score. This is stored in a list in the main function.
translationCount() accepts a DNA sequence and a reading frame adjustment.  The function reads the sequence in that reading frame and returns a dictionary of amino acid counts in the corresponding protein.
trimmer() accepts a list of headers, sequences, and quality scores (generated by parser()), uses a 3-base sliding window and a user-defined quality score to trim sequences, and then writes trimmed sequences into a user-defined fastq file.
